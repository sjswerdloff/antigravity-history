## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🧠 **AI Thinking Process** | Export the hidden reasoning chains behind every AI response |
| 📝 **Code Diffs** | Capture every code edit with full diff context |
| 💻 **Command Outputs** | Preserve terminal outputs with exit codes and working directories |
| ⏰ **Per-Message Timestamps** | Precise timing for every message in the conversation |
| 🔄 **Conversation Recovery** | Scan `.pb` files on disk to recover conversations lost after crashes |
| 📁 **Auto-.pb Scanning** | Automatically finds and exports unindexed conversations from disk |
| 🖥️ **Zero-Config Discovery** | Automatically finds all running Antigravity instances |
| 🔐 **100% Local & Read-Only** | No internet, no tracking, no data modification |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
pip install antigravity-history==0.2.6 --index-url https://pypi.org/simple --no-cache-dir
```

```bash
aghistory export          # ← start here!
```

---

## 📋 Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `aghistory export` | Export conversations to Markdown / JSON |
| `aghistory list` | List all indexed conversations |
| `aghistory recover` | Recover conversations lost after crashes/updates |
| `aghistory info` | Show LanguageServer connection status |

### Export Detail Level (progressive — higher level includes all below)

```bash
aghistory export                     # Basic: user messages + AI responses + tool summaries
aghistory export --thinking          # ↑ + AI thinking chains, timestamps, exit codes, cwd
aghistory export --full              # ↑ + full code diffs, command outputs, search results, model name
```

### Export Scope (filters, independent of each other)

```bash
aghistory export                     # All conversations
aghistory export --today             # Only today's conversations
aghistory export --id abc123         # Specific conversation by cascade ID (repeatable)
```

### Output Format & Path

```bash
aghistory export                     # Default: all formats (md + json)
aghistory export -f md               # Markdown only
aghistory export -f json             # JSON only
aghistory export -o ./my_folder      # Custom output directory
```

### Common Combinations

```bash
# Export today's conversations with AI thinking, as Markdown
aghistory export --today --thinking -f md

# Export a specific conversation with full detail, as JSON
aghistory export --id abc123 --full -f json

# Export everything to a custom folder
aghistory export -o ./my_backup
```

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Does Antigravity need to be running?</b></summary>

Yes. The tool communicates with Antigravity's local LanguageServer API, which is only available while Antigravity is open with at least one workspace.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What are the three export levels?</b></summary>

- **Default**: User messages, AI responses, tool call summaries
- **`--thinking`**: + AI reasoning process, timestamps, exit codes
- **`--full`**: + code diffs, command outputs, search summaries, model info
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What does "recover" do?</b></summary>

Antigravity stores conversations as `.pb` files on disk, but sometimes loses track of them in its index (e.g., after crashes or updates). The `recover` command scans these files and reloads them through the API.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use this as a Python library?</b></summary>

Yes! You can import and use it directly in your Python code:

```python
from antigravity_history.discovery import discover_language_servers, find_all_endpoints
from antigravity_history.api import get_all_trajectories_merged, get_trajectory_steps
from antigravity_history.parser import parse_steps, FieldLevel
from antigravity_history.formatters import format_markdown, format_json
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it support Cursor / Windsurf / other IDEs?</b></summary>

Not yet. Currently Antigravity-only. Multi-IDE support is on the roadmap.
</details>
